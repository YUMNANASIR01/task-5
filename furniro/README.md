## 🔄 **Core Workflows**  

### 1. **User Registration**  
1. **Step 1:** User navigates to `/register`.  
2. **Step 2:** Fills out the registration form.  
3. **Step 3:** Frontend validates inputs and sends a POST request to the API.  
4. **Step 4:** Backend creates the user in Sanity CMS.  
5. **Step 5:** Sends a confirmation email for account activation.  

### 2. **Product Browsing**  
```mermaid
graph TD
A[User selects category] --> B[Frontend fetches from Sanity API]
B --> C[Sanity returns product data]
C --> D[Frontend displays products]

3. Order Placement
Steps:
Add products to the cart.
Proceed to checkout.
Make payments via Stripe API.
Confirm the order and store in Sanity CMS.

🚨 Error Handling
Strategies
Frontend Fallbacks:
Display a user-friendly error message if products fail to load.
Retry failed API calls up to three times.

const fetchData = async (url, retries = 3) => {  
  try {  
    const response = await fetch(url);  
    return await response.json();  
  } catch (error) {  
    if (retries > 0) return fetchData(url, retries - 1);  
    throw error;  
  }  
};

Backend Logging:

Monitor errors with Sentry or New Relic.
Alert administrators for critical failures (e.g., payment issues).
Validation:

Sanity schema for data consistency.
Implement rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests/minute via Redis).
